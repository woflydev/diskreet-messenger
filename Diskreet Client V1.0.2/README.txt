Thank you for downloading Diskreet Messenger Client V1.0.1! Go ahead and launch the application through double-clicking 'launcher.exe'.

If you think it's a virus, don't worry (you probably have reason to) bear with us and we will outline exactly what it does when you execute it.

1. The launcher checks what directory it is running from.
2. It changes directory to the Diskreet Client file folder using that information.
3. It establishes a LOCALHOST server on TCP port 6969 (wow, so funny) which is a network protocol that allows for secure packet communication with zero loss!
4. It then queries the central server to see if it is open for business on a private domain, so that your recipients will actually receive the messages you send.
5. The launcher then goes on to open a web browser for you at localhost:6969, and you will be directed to the Diskreet Client home page.

Happy communicating!
