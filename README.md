Source code is currently in a separate, private repository as of now. We will be steadily releasing source code to the public as development continues.

# What is Diskreet Messenger?
As the name suggests, Diskreet Messenger is built from the ground up behind one design philosophy:

> Anonymity is a Human Right. 

With the ability to create **unlimited rooms** within the Diskreet chat environment, **Peer-2-Peer TLS End-to-End encryption (coming soon)**, and **username swapping at a glance**, Diskreet has you covered if you want to talk, chat, muse, or ponder things with your friends quickly, privately, and securely. 

Diskreet follows behind open-source projects such as Mozilla Firefox, in that we **do not** collect your data in any way, shape, or form, subseqently meaning that we cannot sell it. We **do not** install anything onto your device when the client is used. No junk files, no cache, no cookies (or biscuits), nothing. This is also the reason why we utilize LocalHost for a User Interface instead of a traditional clunky installer. 

We completely guarantee full anonymity. Messages are **completely stored in RAM**, and will be permanently wiped every time the server self-reboots. We **don't** track your IP address, have ads, store your bank details, use biscuits, sell your credit card information, yada yada yada. The only person that is in charge of your privacy is you. 

**If you screw up, that's not on us.**

Featuring a slick and minimal UI that puts user experience first based on the ReactJS framework, Diskreet offers fast transitions and balance between chatting and security.

Diskreet is lightweight, elegant, beautiful, non-resource intensive, and easy on old computers and architecture. It is able to run on any device that supports modern browsers and is a simply *whopping* 7 whole megabytes in size when fully unzipped.

**Diskreet Messenger and Diskreet Client are backed by Diskreet Incorporated, a 100% not-for-profit organization.**

# Feature Roadmap into the far, far future...
This is an approximation of the features and other interesting titbits of information we hope to release in the coming months. Please note that these are **subject to change without notice** and we reserve the right to change this roadmap at our discretion.

- Client-side server IP configuation.
- Release of Diskreet Servers so that you yourself may host one if you wish to do so locally.

# What platforms are supported?
Currently, **only Windows machines are supported** due to the nature of the launcher. However, we are actively developing MacOS and Linux native applications and plan to have them added into the Diskreet family sometime in the future!

If you would like to support this project by contributing and/or porting it over to MacOS or Linux, shoot me an email at wolfy.coding@gmail.com and we can arrange a fork or pull request of the source code.

**TL:DR**
- Windows 11 - **Supported**. Native Platform.
- Windows 10 - **Supported**.
- MacOS - **Not supported**. Native application in active development.
- Linux (all distros) - **Not supported**. Native application in active development.

# Okay, cool, so how do I get started?
